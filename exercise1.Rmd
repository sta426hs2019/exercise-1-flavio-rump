## First Week Exercise

Plotting The Log Normal Distribution
```{r Code Block 1, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}

datapoints <- rlnorm(100, 1, 0.25)
loggedpoints <- log(datapoints)



# Plotly chart 
library(plotly)
plot_ly(x = datapoints, type = "histogram", histnorm = "probability") %>% 
    layout(title = "Histogram of Distribution", 
         xaxis = list(title = "Values"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Prevalence"))
  
plot_ly(x = loggedpoints, type = "histogram", histnorm = "probability") %>% 
  layout(title = "Histogram of Log Distribution", 
         xaxis = list(title = "Values"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Prevalence"))

```

The mean of this distribution is `r mean(datapoints)`, and the variance is `r var(datapoints)`.
